This is the set of rails commands to emulate:
x db:drop
  - This will need to be done manually from Neon, or whichever database provider is chosen.
x db:encryption:init
  - The database credentials do not need to be hidden, the IaC takes care of the concern.
x db:environment:set
  - This is taken care of by the IaC.
x db:fixtures:load
  - This concept will not be implemented.
- db:migrate
- db:migrate:down
x db:migrate:redo
  - This concept will not be implemented.
- db:migrate:status
- db:migrate:up
x db:prepare
  - This is taken care of by the IaC.
- db:reset
x db:rollback
  - This is a duplicate of db:migrate:down and will not be implemented.
x db:schema:cache:clear
  - This concept will not be implemented.
x db:schema:cache:dump
  - This concept will not be implemented.
x db:schema:dump
  - This concept will not be implemented. This will be implemented by the db:migrate:* commands.
x db:schema:load
  - This concept will not be implemented. This will be implemented by the db:migrate:* commands.
- db:seed
x db:seed:replant
