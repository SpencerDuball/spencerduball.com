# Todo

- [x] Consolidate the "Welcome" from the index page
- [x] Create a file & schema for paginated posts & pagination on the posts page
- [x] Change the pagination numbers to not be divisible by 5, check that this works correctly
- [x] Build a script to generate lorem ipsum
- [x] Use Figma to correctly build the favicon. This has metadata from excalidraw
- [x] Correct the favicons to use correct dark favicon
- [x] Generate all metadata (head, favicon, etc) for publishing, use `realfavicongenerator.net` for this
- [x] Create a global 404 route
- [ ] Add better error handling and `errorComponent` to the routes with path parameters.
- [ ] Create the mdx component for the actual posts
- [ ] Add in the "moving ants" underline animation to the BlogLi elements
- [ ] Add in the "moving wavy" underline animation to the top-level navigation
- [ ] (maybe) Add an icon animation to the title for "Posts", "Projects", "Series" headers. Could be a quill moving, construction hammer, lights in series or train?
- [ ] Add in snake animation to the 404 page
